#____________________________________________________BLENDING ALL TOGETHER________________________________________________#

#In the last few exercises you've learned everything there is to know about heights and weights of baseball players. Now it's time to dive into another sport: soccer.

#You've contacted FIFA for some data and they handed you two lists. The lists are the following:

#positions = ['GK', 'M', 'A', 'D', ...]
#heights = [191, 184, 185, 180, ...]
#Each element in the lists corresponds to a player. The first list, positions, contains strings representing each player's position. The possible positions are: 'GK' (goalkeeper)
#, 'M' (midfield), 'A' (attack) and 'D' (defense). The second list, heights, contains integers representing the height of the player in cm. The first player in the lists is a
#goalkeeper and is pretty tall (191 cm).
#You're fairly confident that the median height of goalkeepers is higher than that of other players on the soccer field. Some of your friends don't believe you, so you are
#determined to show them using the data you received from FIFA and your newly acquired Python skills.

# heights and positions are available as lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_positions = np.array(positions)
np_heights = np.array(heights)

# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights = np_heights[np_positions == 'GK']

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights = np_heights[np_positions != 'GK']

# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))
